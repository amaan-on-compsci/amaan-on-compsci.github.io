# PersonalWebsite
This repository is dedicated to a personal website that I made for an assignment in my "Intro to Software Engineering" course. 
The website gives the visitor a brief idea of who I am, including my skillset and some of the projects I've worked on. 
The content is divided into sections that show off relevant information and allow the user to interact with me and get access to my social media.
